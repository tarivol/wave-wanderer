# Wave Wanderer - concept
## Functionality
1. Radio Music inspired
    1. Stations play in background
    2. Tune in to different stations 
2. "noisy crossfade" between stations
    1. Station A <-> white noise <-> Station B
    2. "virtual detents" on potentiometer where stations are for easy tuning
    3. "weight" of potentiometer - averaging for acceleration effect
3. different "bandwidths" - sets of radio stations
    1. Each contains max 10 stations
## Hardware
1. Teensy 4.0 based
2. External DAC for audio
    1. stereo
    2. high quality
    3. I2S
3. Potentiometer for tuning
4. CV input for tuning
5. 2 bandwidth switching buttons
